## Points
- For Individuals because it's completely in our control.
- Cannot be relied on for groups. Need systemic change there (slow but scalable). 
	- This is also why studies and books in habit prefer systemic change. It's hard to get knowledge about willpower.

For an understanding of what willpower is, check out Lsusr's post first. Here, I will be discussing why it is important.

In [Extreme Rationality - it's not that great], [x] writes 
> One factor we have to once again come back to is akrasia2. I find akrasia in myself and others to be the most important limiting factor to our success. Think of that phrase "limiting factor" formally, the way you'd think of the limiting reagent in chemistry. When there's a limiting reagent, it doesn't matter how much more of the other reagents you add, the reaction's not going to make any more product. Rational decisions are practically useless without the [[Willpower]] to carry them out. If our limiting reagent is [[Willpower]] and not rationality, throwing truckloads of rationality into our brains isn't going to increase success very much.

We are being sucked into being biased towards systemic mechanisms, and away from brute-force. Methods like the ones [ ] mentioned in habit books teach us to trick our subconscious by identifying the loop cycle and changing the variables in that cycle to automatically get the desired result. Not too much, because then it'll be a lot. Go to the gym for 5 minutes, write 1 paragraph, meditate for 10 minutes, etc.
You know what's a better way to form habits? If it's writing, start writing. If it's working out, start working out. If it's meditation, start meditating.
