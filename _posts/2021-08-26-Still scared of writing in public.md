**Epistemic Status**: General introspection  
**Writing Duration**: 35m

I'm still unable to put my rawish thoughts onto the internet. Since I started the [experiment](https://aayushkucheria.github.io/posts/Should-I-write-(publicly)/), I have written considerably more than I generally do - but all of it has been in private. THAT DOESN'T HELP. I have already cultivated the habit of writing. My goal with this experiment is to go one level up. Hmm, but what exactly does that mean?

Potential "Levels Ups"
1. Learn to be comfortable with being vulnerable
2. Put my thoughts in public for criticism
3. Make what/how I think more transparent to others
4. Use writing in public as a forcing function to increase my quality bit by bit

It looks like **1** is the core action I need to optimize for. **2** should follow it, and **3** is simply a side-effect. I deliberately don't want to focus on quality right now, so I can postpone **4**. Good. Now, let's think about how I can optimize **1**.

A good idea would be to minimize the activation energy needed to achieve **1** and iteratively build up over time. The biggest barrier here is the possibility that people will read these posts and not like them. This fear is why I'm behind on my first experiment. The fear is apparently quite strong. I'll reduce its effect for now by not linking to this blog from anywhere. This would make it so that there's a very low chance anybody would find this blog. But, there would still be *a* possibility. Let's get comfortable with that first.
