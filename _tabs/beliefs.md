- **Collaboration:** We're facing problems whose nature we cannot intuitively grasp, making it essential for us to work together.
	- **Conviction:** Expressing conviction about our beliefs, uncertainties, and actions makes visible how strongly we believe what we're saying, which is an important data point for the observers.
- **Longtermism:** We are one of the earliest humans, and thus bear the responsibility of safeguarding humanity's potential by managing the risks of today, averting those of tomorrow, and becoming the kind of society that will never be vulnerable to risks again.
- **Knowledge:** A powerful knowledge base consists of a strongly connected graph that's constantly expanding and seeking new nodes to integrate itself with.
	- **Need:** Learning is necessary because what we can know is limited by what we do know.
	- **Expansion:** Learning, when seen as knowledge graph expansion, is easy if we can strongly integrate the incoming information with our pre-existing knowledge. It's vastly harder if we can't.
- **Optionality:** Maximising future optionality makes us antifragile by not letting us put constraints on our future self - who is nonlinearly better than us and needs to respond effectively to unexpected knowledge, opportunities, and problems that invariably arise with time.
- **Tool:** A tool must form an intimate connection with its user by becoming an extension of that person.
- **Empathy:** Empathy is recognizing the other's experiences as worthy of consideration.
- **Purpose:** It's not what's the most fun to do, it's not even what you have talent to do. It's what you need to do that you ought to be doing. (Quoted from Eliezer Yudkowsky [here](https://www.airr.io/quote/60f69eccb4ada6000f73df1b))
