Hey! I'm Aayush. I'm based in Helsinki and I think a lot about how people and AI systems interact.

Right now I'm a Research Fellow at [Live Machinery](https://groundless.ai), a non-profit AI safety institute. I work on designing how humans and AI can actually think together — not just chatbots, but real collaborative sensemaking.

### Things I've worked on

**LLM Tutors vs. Human Tutors** — I built a framework to compare how GPT-4o, Gemini, and LLaMA teach vs. how humans teach. Turns out they're quite different. Presented at ACL 2025 in Vienna.

**Concept Processing in LLMs** — Built tools to peek inside language models and understand how they process concepts. Part of AI Safety Camp 2024.

**AI in the Newsroom** — Analyzed 75k news articles to see if AI was changing how news gets written. (It is.) [Code here.](https://github.com/AayushKucheria/AI-in-the-Newsroom)

### Background

I studied AI at Aalto University (BSc + MSc), with a minor in quantum technology because why not. I've mentored AI safety groups at Stanford, TU Delft, and others through the Center for Effective Altruism.
