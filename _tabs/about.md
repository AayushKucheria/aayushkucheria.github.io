I'm an AI researcher specializing in Human-AI Interaction, AI in Education, and understanding the inner workings of Language Models. Based in Helsinki, Finland.

Currently a **Research Fellow** at [Live Machinery](https://livemachinery.com), a non-profit AI safety research institute, where I work on human-AI interface design and collaborative sensemaking — developing frameworks for fluid interaction paradigms that reduce epistemic bureaucratization.

## Research

**Comparing Behavioral Patterns of LLM and Human Tutors** — ACL 2025, BEA Workshop
: Built an experimental framework comparing LLM teaching patterns (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, LLaMA 3.1) with human tutors using the CIMA dataset. Identified systematic deviations in tutoring actions, response complexity, and behavioral patterns. Presented in Vienna.

**Concept Processing in LLMs** — Ethical Landscaping, AI Safety Camp (2024)
: Architected a pipeline for systematic analysis of large language models. Developed methodology for statistical validation of token distribution patterns and extraction of complex relationships from model behavior data.

**AI in the Newsroom** — Apart Research (2024)
: Analyzed 75,000 news articles to detect AI influence patterns. Identified statistically significant increases in ChatGPT-favored language. [Published analysis](https://github.com/AayushKucheria/AI-in-the-Newsroom).

**Probabilistic Modelling** — University of Helsinki (2023)
: Enhanced Gaussian Process implementation combining neural networks with Stan. [Research report](https://github.com/AayushKucheria/Gaussian-Modeling-Uni-Helsinki).

## Other Work

- **DeepSeek V3 Analysis** (2025) — Presented architecture breakdown at Tutke (Finnish Center for Safe AI)
- **ML Bootcamp Creator** (2022) — Designed and led an intensive 2-week ML program at Aalto University. [Repository](https://github.com/AayushKucheria/ML-Bootcamp).
- **Senior Mentor** (2023–2024) — The Center for Effective Altruism. Guided AI safety student groups from TU Delft, Stanford, Groningen, Liverpool.

## Education

**Aalto University** (2019–2024) — BSc & MSc in Artificial Intelligence, minor in Quantum Technology.
