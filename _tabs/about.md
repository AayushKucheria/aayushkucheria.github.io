Hey there! I'm Aayush.

I'm a curious human who thinks a lot about **ideas**, **technology**, and **how to make things better**. Based in Helsinki, I spend my time exploring the intersection of knowledge, collaboration, and building useful things.

## What I'm Into

- **Writing** - Trying to think out loud and share half-baked ideas publicly (it's scarier than it sounds)
- **Learning** - Building mental models and connecting dots across different domains
- **Building** - Creating tools and systems that help people do meaningful work
- **Long-term thinking** - Interested in how we can make decisions that benefit not just us, but future generations

## Why This Site?

This is my little corner of the internet where I share thoughts, experiments, and things I'm learning. It's part blog, part notebook, part playground.

Feel free to poke around. Check out my [beliefs](/beliefs/) to see what drives me, or dive into my [posts](/archives/) to see what's on my mind lately.
